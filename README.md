# event-manager
[Deploy](https://jazi29.github.io/event-manager/)

- Creation of the basic website structure with a list of events displayed on the homepage. Users can browse events without the option to register. (Flexbox and grids used)
- Development of pages with event details, including information about the venue, time, and ticket availability. (A separate JSON file has been created, and data is displayed on the page using fetch)
- Implementation of event registration feature allowing users to reserve spots (incomplete).


There were issues with:

- User authentication and registration.
- Ticket reservation and their display on the page.
